			<td>ALASKAN MALAMUTE</td>
			<td>Alaskan Malamutes are very playful in my opinion. They are also incredibly big for their size and they are affectionate and loyal to their owners. In a pack, they like to howl at night around the time my neighbors are sleeping. This is my dog, Freddy. We've had him since 2009 and he has passed away a few months ago. My family and I miss him very much.</td>

			<td>SAINT BERNARD</td>
			<td>Saint Bernards are very big and powerful dogs. They have floppy ears and their eyes are droopy and sometimes a bit red. The fur colors of a Saint Bernard are red, white, and brown. This is my dog, JJ. We adopted him last year February and he has been growing very fast! He is strong and playful towards other dogs and he gets excited when meeting new people.</td>

			<td>GOLDEN RETRIEVER</td>
			<td>Golden Retievers are very energetic with much love and care! They are well known for their golden fur coat and they are friendly and intelligent dogs. This is my dog, Jazz. We've had her since 2010 and she sadly passed away a few months ago as well. We miss her and Freddy, they were my bestfriends while I was growing up.</td>
